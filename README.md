## New Video Generation Feature

We have added a new feature that allows users to generate AI-based videos. Here are the instructions on how to use this feature:

1. Navigate to the "Generate" page in the app.
2. Enter the URL of the video you want to generate.
3. Click the "Generate Video" button.
4. Wait for the video to be generated. You will see a loading spinner while the video is being generated.
5. Once the video is generated, it will be displayed on the page. You can play the video directly from the app.

This feature uses the OpenAI API to generate videos based on the provided URL. Make sure to have your OpenAI API key configured in the environment variables.
